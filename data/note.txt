The data.json file read from the API is automatically created here once app.js is running.

Once app.js runs, data from the API call is fetched and stored here as data.json 

NOTE:
1. data.json file does not exist initially
2. After running app.js, data.json file is created here
3. The data.json file keeps updating everytime app.js is run. 
4. data.json file can be deleted.

data.json contains the data that is fetched from the API call while running app.js in realtime.
